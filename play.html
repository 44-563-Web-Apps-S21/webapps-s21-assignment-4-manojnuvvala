        <h3>Winter's Tale Othello</h3>
        <h5>SCENE II. A prison.</h5>
            <p>Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants</p>
            <h6>PAULINA</h6>
            <p>The keeper of the prison, call to him;
            let him have knowledge who I am.
            Exit Gentleman</p>
            <p>
            Good lady,
            No court in Europe is too good for thee;
            What dost thou then in prison?
            Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, good sir,
            You know me, do you not?</p>
           
            <h6>Gaoler</h6>
            <p>For a worthy lady
            And one whom much I honour.</p>
            <h6>PAULINA</h6>
            <p>Pray you then,
            Conduct me to the queen.</p>
            <h6>Gaoler</h6>
            <p>I may not, madam:
            To the contrary I have express commandment.</p>
            <h6>PAULINA</h6>
            <p>Here's ado,
            To lock up honesty and honour from
            The access of gentle visitors!
            Is't lawful, pray you,
            To see her women? any of them? Emilia?</p>
            <h6>Gaoler</h6>
            <p>So please you, madam,
            To put apart these your attendants, I
            Shall bring Emilia forth.</p>
            <h6>PAULINA</h6>
            <p>I pray now, call her.
            Withdraw yourselves.
            Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants</p>

            <h6>Gaoler</h6>
            <p>And, madam,
            I must be present at your conference.</p>
            <h6>PAULINA</h6>
            <p>Well, be't so, prithee.
            Exit Gaoler</p>

            <p>Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
            As passes colouring.
            Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA

            Dear gentlewoman,
            How fares our gracious lady?</p>
