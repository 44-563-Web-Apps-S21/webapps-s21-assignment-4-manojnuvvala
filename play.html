        <h3>Winter's Tale Othello</h3>
        <h5>SCENE II. A prison.</h5>
            Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants
            PAULINA
            The keeper of the prison, call to him;
            let him have knowledge who I am.
            Exit Gentleman

            Good lady,
            No court in Europe is too good for thee;
            What dost thou then in prison?
            Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler

            Now, good sir,
            You know me, do you not?
            Gaoler
            For a worthy lady
            And one whom much I honour.
            PAULINA
            Pray you then,
            Conduct me to the queen.
            Gaoler
            I may not, madam:
            To the contrary I have express commandment.
            PAULINA
            Here's ado,
            To lock up honesty and honour from
            The access of gentle visitors!
            Is't lawful, pray you,
            To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
            Gaoler
            So please you, madam,
            To put apart these your attendants, I
            Shall bring Emilia forth.
            PAULINA
            I pray now, call her.
            Withdraw yourselves.
            Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants

            Gaoler
            And, madam,
            I must be present at your conference.
            PAULINA
            Well, be't so, prithee.
            Exit Gaoler

            Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
            As passes colouring.
            Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA

            Dear gentlewoman,
            How fares our gracious lady?
